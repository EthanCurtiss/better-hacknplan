# better-hacknplan

The free version of HacknPlan is ugly. This fixes that. If it works, yay! If it doesn't, oops. I'm new-ish to JavaScript.

Grab the Chrome extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-hacknplan/bccmpgidnjoppjfljlglfchagcloakag.

This extension is no longer being worked on. Fork it if you want to change anything.
